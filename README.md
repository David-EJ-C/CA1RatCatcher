CA1 for DKIT PFIE Desktop Application-Niall McGuinness.


My screencast is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/6cvdl_7BxaA,


This package contains a a complete build and is over 11GB in project file size (Downloadable from Onedrive as github/lab say its too big).

There are 3 main scenes and 2 supplemental for Menu switches.

There are 2 CutScenes (1 with soft post processing and shaders using URP settings)- intro to the game and in game.

The object is to pick up from when the game loads and locate a city Boss called Tony T via a mission start trigger, get instructions and find the items listed to avenge 
the murder of your colleague.

use of 3rd party resources, tutorials, etc I will include a README with a complete link 
to the source material below(i.e., <TITLE>, <URL>, Accessed On: <MM/YY>).

You may also want to have a look at the folders for checking scripts, scenes, Assets, images, textures, materials, Post processing, animations, models, etc.

A 225 page document accompanies this README and gives an extensive ouverview of the developemnt process from start to finish with screenshots, thoughts, brief explaniers and trouble-shoots.

Texture-Sets for the assets and colors are included.

Textures-sizes between 1024x1024 to 2048x2048.

I cannot give a polygon count unfortunatley.

The original FBXs-files also included in this package from Mixamo.

A quick tune I thought sounded quite action/sci fi style. Modern dub step style bass line just for fun. Can be lengthened if need be.
Created using an M-Audio Mini 32 via Ignite Software.
